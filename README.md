Purpose: This is a simple model that relates to aspects of the fear framework in ecology. The model will answer the question: does an ecosystem that contains only the highest quality foods always support a large and stable population for a species that relies on this resource?

Entities, variables, and scales: 
Entities: a heterotrophic species. EX: animals, fungi
Variables: initial number of individuals, growth rates of organisms, birth and death rates, amount of food, availability of food
Note: the assumption of no immigration/emmigration, linear growth rate, fixed habitat, no intraspecies competition for food 
Scale: scale is the habitat size of of the entity species. This will vary based on species studied. 

Process Overview: Analysis of changes in entities and food to determine if there are scenarios where highest quality foods cannot support a large and stable population.  

Initialization: how do the food rates and population rates interact? I predict that lower food availability and higher growth rates will support smaller populations. Higher reproduction rates with high growth rates could lead to reduction of food and population crashes AKA. variable population.

Description of different subroutines/functions/actions that need to happen in the model: 
1. the function of the initial population and change in popultation, along with growth rate 
2. the function of the inital amount of food, changes in amount of food, and the availability of food.
